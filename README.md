## Getting Started (Local Development)

### Prerequisites

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) or [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (both are pre-installed in GitHub Codespaces)

### Running Locally

1. **Clone or open the repo in Codespaces or locally.**
2. **Start a local web server:**

   Using Python 3:
   ```sh
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
   Or using Node.js:
   ```sh
   npx serve .
   ```

3. **Open your browser and go to:**
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```
   (In Codespaces, use the "Ports" tab and click "Open in Browser" for port 8000.)

### File Structure

- `index.html` — Main HTML file, loads all scripts and styles externally
- `main.js` — All app logic and UI rendering (Preact)
- `style.css` — All custom styles
- `site.webmanifest` — PWA manifest (optional)
- `assets/` — Icons and images

### CSP & Security

- No inline `<script>` or `<style>` tags (all JS and CSS are external)
- Content Security Policy (CSP) is strict for security
- Google Analytics is commented out for local development

## Customization

- Update `main.js` to change UI logic or add integrations (Firebase, Stripe, etc.)
- Update `style.css` for custom styles and themes

## Deployment

- Deploy to Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or any static hosting provider
- Make sure all external scripts and styles are accessible

## Troubleshooting

- If you only see the spinner, check the browser console for errors
- Make sure all scripts are loaded and there are no CSP violations
- For Codespaces, use the provided port preview feature
